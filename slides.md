# Motivating Questions

- How many viruses are out there?
- How can we discover them?

# Data Source
<!-- To be continued -->
- Publicly available metagenomic data sets from the IMG/M system.
    - 1,729 environmental samples
    - 1,079 host-associated samples
    - 234 engineered samples

Engineered: originating from the "built environment". Check "MicroBENet".

# Metagenomic mining identified expanded diversity of viruses

# Host-Virus interactions mapped by mining disparate data sources

- Viral "Groups": Project known host-virus interactions.
- CRISPR-Cas: identify virus-prokaryote pairings.
- Viral tRNA: match to host genomes.

This is the one place where I think the paper uncovers new insights.

# Viruses can be found basically all known environments

# Viruses are shared between geographical locations
