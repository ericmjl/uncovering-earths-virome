# Motivating Questions

- How many viruses are out there?
- How can we discover them?

# Data Source
<!-- To be continued -->
- Metagenomics Databases
- Sampling

# Result 1: Expanded Known Viral Diversity

<!-- To be continued -->

# Host-Virus interactions mapped by mining disparate data sources

- Viral "Groups": Project known host-virus interactions.
- CRISPR-Cas: identify virus-prokaryote pairings.
- Viral tRNA: match to host genomes.

# Expanded view of host-virus interactions using mined matches
