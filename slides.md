# Motivation

- How many viruses are out there?
- How can we discover them?

# Data Source

- Metagenomics Databases
- Sampling

# Result 1: Expanded Known Viral Diversity

# Result 2: Host-Virus Interactions

Mine host-virus interactions by combining data:

- Viral "Groups": Project known host-virus interactions.
- CRISPR-Cas: identify virus-prokaryote pairings.
- Viral tRNA: match to host genomes.

# Result 2:

# Result 3: Biogeography
